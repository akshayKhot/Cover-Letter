Hello,

My name is Akshay, and I am a software developer based in Victoria, BC with more than four years of experience as a full-stack .NET developer. I wanted to express my interest in the Rails Engineer position at Uscreen. 

I have worked on all layers of the stack, including the database, back-end, and front-end. So far, most of my professional experience has been in the Windows and Azure ecosystem, with a few side projects on Linux. I am proficient in C# and TypeScript, as I use them daily at my current job at CityView. On the framework side, I am competent in .NET and Node ecosystems. I also have some DevOps experience as I am currently migrating our enterprise software systems to Docker and containerizing our legacy applications.

You might wonder why I am applying for a Ruby/Rails developer role position when clearly I am a Windows .NET developer. Even though I started learning Ruby a few months ago and haven't professionally worked on Ruby (or Rails) stack, I fell in love with the programming language as soon as I started learning it for one of my side projects and would like to build my career in it. I am reasonably competent in Ruby, intending to master the language and keep getting better at it. For this reason, I am willing to start as a Junior Ruby developer and work my way up. 

As a software developer, my primary goal is to build useful software that solves problems and provides value to the users, and I approach all my projects with the same mindset. I am very passionate about software development and am always looking forward to learning new skills and becoming a better software developer. 

I have attached my resume to this application. Please let me know if you need any other details from me. I look forward to hearing back from you.

Regards,

Akshay Khot
